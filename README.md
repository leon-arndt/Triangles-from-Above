## Lessons Learned
I learned how valuable it can be to understand the systems working behind a game engine. I had been taking the Unity hierarchy and its component system for granted. Understanding the principles on which those are based really helped me to understand their power.
I am thankful for the opportunity to build something myself and I learned a lot about memory allocation and the limitations of different approaches.
